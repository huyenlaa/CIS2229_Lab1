# Welcome to CIS2229 First Lab!
For the next two weeks, you will be creating a simple website and hosting it on Temple's server.
The first part of the lab is to create the website! This project here is a template for you to use.
Feel free to use other tools to help you create your site.

**Please refer to the lab manual in the Canvas page for the rubric and requirements**

### How to get template's code
- Option 1: Click on [Code] and then download the ZIP file. Open the ZIP file in a text editor or IDE like Visual Studios Code.
- Option 2: If you have a Github account, you can fork a copy of the repo and then clone it using the URL.
  - Ask the TA for help if you would like to do it this way! Having a repo allows you to save your changes periodically like a save point.
